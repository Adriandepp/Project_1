        <h1>My Favorite Film Director: Stanley Kubrik.</h1>

            <h2>About Stanley Kubrik</h2>
            <!-- -->
            <p> Stanley Kubrick (/ˈkuːbrɪk/; July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) was an American film director, producer,
                screenwriter, and photographer. Widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, his films,
                almost all of which are adaptations of novels or short stories, cover a wide range of genres and are
                noted for their innovative cinematography, dark humor, realistic attention to detail and extensive set
                designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kubrick was raised in the Bronx, New York City, and attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941
                to 1945. He received average grades but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film
                from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from
                high school. After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he
                began making short films on shoestring budgets, and made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing,
                for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas: the war picture
                Paths of Glory (1957) and the historical epic Spartacus (1960).
                Creative differences arising from his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of the Hollywood
                industry, and a growing concern about crime in America prompted Kubrick to move to the United Kingdom in
                1961, where he spent most of his remaining life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in
                Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing,
                research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete
                artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major
                Hollywood studios. His first productions in Britain were two films with Peter Sellers: Lolita (1962), an
                adaptation of the Vladimir Nabokov novel, and the Cold War black comedy Dr. Strangelove (1964).
                A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, from
                direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging
                scenes, working in close coordination with his actors, crew, and other collaborators. He often asked for
                several dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts.
                Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in
                cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of the science fiction epic 2001:
                A Space Odyssey (1968) were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only
                personal Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation's
                "big bang"; it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.

                While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon
                release—particularly the brutal A Clockwork Orange (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the
                UK following a mass media frenzy—most were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and
                underwent critical reevaluations. For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon (1975), Kubrick obtained
                lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA, to film scenes under natural candlelight. With the horror film The
                Shining (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid
                tracking shots, a technology vital to his Vietnam War film Full Metal Jacket (1987). His last film, Eyes
                Wide Shut, was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70.

        <h2>Mysterious Death</h2>
        <P> Some have suggested that Kubrick had, in fact, been murdered by way of a Masonic Satanic poisoning in line
            with the subjects of the film. Kubrick had suffered a myocardial infarction in his sleep, which is said to
            be easy to induce through simple poisoning.
        </P>
        <P>
            The exposure of the secret organisations of the wealthy elite may have ruffled a few feathers, to say the
            least. Though evidently, with the news in recent years of the despicable behaviour of Jeffrey Epstein,
            Ghislaine Maxwell and most likely Prince Andrew too, there are almost certainly still active organisations
            that engage in illicit sex parties, though their Satanic nature is yet to be confirmed.
            However, it ought it be stressed that if anyone has a need to keep something secret, then it would likely be
            the organisations depicted in Eyes Wide Shut. So too, do those sects have the financial power to keep things
            hush, whether by paying off artists and journalists or engaging in strict confidentiality of its members.
            Many of the elite also have a vested interest in the film industry. Eyes Wide Shut was based (like many of
            Kubrick’s works) on a piece of literature. This time was Arthur Schnitzler’s 1926 novella Dream Story.
            However, film is by far a more popular medium than literature, so whoever had their hands on the working
            knowledge and understanding of Eyes Wide Shut knew that, given Kubrick’s stature, the film was likely to be
            viewed by millions.
        </P>
        <P>


            So while it is understood that Kubrick’s cause of death was a heart attack, several signs suggest that
            perhaps it was not as simple as reported. Although Kubrick had already completed the film, and it was
            ultimately released to acclaim, so whoever may (or may not) have wanted to stop the film from being shown
            could have done more to prevent it (especially given their suspected power).
        </P>
